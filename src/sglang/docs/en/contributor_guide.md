## Format Your Code
Use these commands to format your code and pass CI linting tests.

```
pip3 install pre-commit
cd sglang
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Add Unit Tests
Add unit tests under [sglang/test](../../test). You can learn how to add and run tests from the README.md in that folder.
